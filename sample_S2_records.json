Recent data appear to support a paradigm shift toward neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS). We hypothesized that stage IV ovarian cancer patients would likely benefit from NACT-IDS by achieving similar outcomes with less morbidity. Patients with stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent primary treatment between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2007, were identified. Data were retrospectively extracted. Each patient record was evaluated to subclassify stage IV disease according to the sites of tumor dissemination at the time of diagnosis. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to compare overall survival (OS) data. A total of 242 newly diagnosed stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer patients were included in the final analysis; 176 women (73%) underwent PDS, 45 (18%) NACT-IDS, and 21 (9%) chemotherapy only. The frequency of achieving complete resection to no residual disease was significantly higher in patients with NACT-IDS versus PDS (27% vs. 7.5%; P < 0.001). When compared to women treated with NACT-IDS, women with PDS had longer admissions (12 vs. 8 days; P = 0.01), more frequent intensive care unit admissions (12% vs. 0%; P = 0.01), and a trend toward a higher rate of postoperative complications (27% vs. 15%; P = 0.08). The patients who received only chemotherapy had a median OS of 23 months, compared to 33 months in the NACT-IDS group and 29 months in the PDS group (P = 0.1). NACT-IDS for stage IV ovarian cancer resulted in higher rates of complete resection to no residual disease, less morbidity, and equivalent OS compared to PDS.","inCitations":["505715691a8360f67f1cfcb4f2a45c8652a01612","450a0ef76fd457deb30a99c6ca22ae30263273fc","edf1163e8dfcf0575842d03dfc143e6457d0ff5c","2282d6014362447b8d9b983bf43ca71d67e48c40","b9d911352437e72e621f80f889709fa849779138","d4aff3783a894062b9f43d657206f573f483fbfd","cbb86bd24472903eb8d54e6aa332fe7f805e307a","ede0d95ef1265dbc27021eb9ae9baf2db3bc0dc8","0bfe29a5f6e572098eb0f5c31ab582bf04328c69","80d103a7b039c46ac3cf3239873adc053ea6afc8","7865324b0684bf8a07dd4a6cf2e0a5b1fa64fc1f","655a5ceb46d974b935695c5f0074a7f9b643958a","2f092623673c875e6accd5a978a10507be306500","f51536c9fd2eeacc88abf84baf7b2f05282db841","c7ed54a5eb89086e0fdf7622fbe88e96890823b7","0cfcae93bf4a955ee1f6b916adf8aebdf8db9aa0","15344e7d627d73551276d5bdf76039ef74461d26","c67082501169a383c972aea0ab9d7f1c72ee43f0","0a60c97d4eceabfb08e8328da67b176bffe36a67","065225e5382d8f998481857b45090074494db957","294f252ac5e0c05c12943bac11ea7a548dbb2620","64df8fea136c83217d239d4bee993750ba15f75e","e005949227ccfe033f578eb11a9c3b546adda2fa","1c18b95b762a9d9d53852bf20c5c5382dadfbd96","81212e90971f4499b2c293f293ab47620460e764","786f4f5b397a0d8aedbe348cc1d3365a3a63b121","9324bd563c8fdaa0d8d49b6120519ef346a90c9a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Primary Debulking Surgery Versus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Stage IV Ovarian Cancer","doi":"10.1245/s10434-011-2100-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-011-2100-x","venue":"Annals of Surgical Oncology"}

Levels of GHRH and beta-actin mRNA were measured from hypothalamic and cortical extracts using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method in rats sacrificed at 4 h intervals across a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. Hypothalamic GHRH mRNA peaked around the light onset, declined during the light period, and stayed low in the dark. Variations in hypothalamic beta-actin and cortical GHRH mRNA levels were not observed. beta-Actin mRNA expression in the cortex was higher in the dark than in the light period. The results demonstrate that hypothalamic GHRH mRNA displays diurnal variations.","inCitations":["d83a5cea9a44989cedc37d1aa261531172bd467f","8f84f6c1b91d3a60af74b2077877bb1add9b2cc1","28e1483eea2312e6bb9a363a455cb6a2c8e11171","0e36524a659e2d2f74ca8572b3af5e59c4936850","3d30ce8793e94980813de473dbb94edadbbbae44","cfa64475f4fb2eb97c0a28bb1dc88151825a522a","48928a00ea6217eaab0ad0afd9514ab90c4b7014","6a0a0a122bd8347ae7d8520d6af054bc02009c9d","5c38915a3a097592502859eb6e68d69a7c995076","d97e7c0a7eb63ce666d4ebaddd2b10855620f7cd","0fbc0649086c14dccaadf3e4e6acc5ceda99bef8","33b34178e1c7ae2c79264a11a4f2a1e2960b7e25","db0a25e615cb180e3c56ac958ca0aafda5e8c91e","46ebb8d96613bb0508688a71e0d6ce67c7e3d041","347259c8a6e3aa72411cf51c4c90e8a0261dd100","9124c0d40c07e2218cb35355daa2c8c0ae2c6e11","6e403304ffbcd631e323e6649080173a12adb4b0","440bb22f215a195958976c416116a189ead92d38","a9c2183f390460b3e415844f892e8d60ce0c84eb","3e93b729fff68fad18794a84a7f30d67124de9a3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone mRNA varies across the day in rats.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Neuroreport"}

Human leukemia K562 cells have been used as a model to study megakaryocytic differentiation. In the present study, to investigate the effects of radiation on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, the cellular processes responsible for the expression of CD41 antigen (GPIIb/IIIa), which is reported to be expressed early in megakaryocyte maturation, were analyzed. The expression of CD41 antigens was significantly increased 72 h after treatment with both 4 Gy X-irradiation and PMA. In this fraction, two populations, CD41(low) and CD41(high) cells, were detected by flow cytometry. The CD41(high) cells sustained intracellular ROS at the initial level for up to 72 h, but CD41(low) cells had reduced ROS by 48 h. The maximum suppressive effect on CD41 expression was observed when N-acetyl cysteine, which is known to act as a ROS scavenger, was administered 48 h after PMA stimulation. When K562 cells were pretreated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, an ERK1/2 inhibitor and a p38 MAPK inhibitor, followed by X-irradiation and PMA stimulation, the reactivity profiles of both inhibitors showed the involvement of MAPK pathway. There is a possibility that the K562 cell population contains at least two types of radiosensitive megakaryocytic progenitors with respect to ROS production mechanisms, and intracellular ROS levels determine the extent of CD41 expression.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of radiation on the maturation of megakaryocytes","doi":"10.1093/jrr/rrs127","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jrr/rrs127","venue":"Journal of radiation research"}

An early diagnosis is therefore necessary.\n\n\nMETHOD/PATIENTS\n182 consecutive patients with an age up to 10 years were diagnosed with permanent hearing loss in the mild to profound range in a defined 5-years-period (1.10.1994-30.9.1999) in the Pedaudiologic Outpatient Clinic of the University Göttingen. Fifty children (27.5%) had a unilateral hearing loss (30 sensorineural, 20 conductive caused by aural atresia with or without microtia), 132 a bilateral one. This paper presents the data of the consecutive series of the 30 sensorineural unilaterally hearing-impaired children (> 25 dB).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA slight male predominance was present (53.3%). The left ear was affected in 43.3%, the right ear in 56.7%. In the majority of the cases the hearing loss was severe and profound. The hearing-impairments were diagnosed by the median age of 69.5 months and all aided by the median age of 70 months. The etiology remained unknown in 60 per cent of the cases. Hearing aid acceptance at the first follow-up (on average after 6 months) was found to be 79 per cent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe data suggest the relevance and necessity of a pedaudiometric prevention. They demonstrate the urgent necessity of a molecular genetic cause investigation. Recessive sensorineural hearing loss with onset in infancy may exist with no antecedent family history.","inCitations":["d74955ebba7ca098f8fcef8534ad60434077a054","a271f9282560f67a89c9b6644d23b83d51e8842a","e5cab4cb71e4359edfdddb1408657445f8530c52","255ef4f76188c53ee7c893c58b5f8345fe1f4837"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Unilateral hearing loss in childhood.

However, with the development of new technologies to measure the intracellular free concentration of magnesium ([Mg2+]i), the biologically important fraction, there has been an explosion of interest in the molecular, biochemical, physiological and pharmacological functions of magnesium. In addition improved methods for assessing magnesium status in the clinic have contributed to the further understanding of magnesium regulation in health and disease. Magnesium deficiency is now considered to contribute to many diseases and the role for magnesium as a therapeutic agent is being tested in numerous large clinical trials. This review focuses on clinical manifestations associated with magnesium deficiency and highlights the clinical significance of hypermagnesemia. Specific clinical conditions in which magnesium deficiency has been implicated to play a pathophysiological role, namely hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, prec-eclampsia, asthma and critical illness will be discussed and the possible therapeutic role of magnesium will be considered. Although there is still much to be learnt regarding the exact role of magnesium in clinical medicine, there are two conditions where magnesium is now considered the therapeutic agent of choice, pre-eclampsia and torsades de pointes. Future research, both at the fundamental and clinical levels, will certainly facilitate our understanding of how magnesium contributes to pathological processes and under what circumstances it should be used therapeutically.","inCitations":["37be949d5beee11e48f9679ce540e1f878156f01","f54cb09cbb8e0aee080895a97fceb26dedb399da","211496e95c651947d3cacc8e85c4ce70e2f1d6a7","ecffbef73f6b81652abe9800f33b76744a65bc1c","49658c1b4df86f17a39ad4836e7501963ae43402","1caa912b83b06dab55bdc63386908a9fad8c8634","15c4293f8d354cee99e7b3c5a48f33ff9080e258","1739491a83e42f9c46bec26964a4b622d0bb98f2","9d3b7069fe792dca00e85e64920073f5e49ab58f","2bffeba7d6aa64327096ea4f7fc16dbb6e8842d4","023b3afd127bdc7683a5df6f72ca5b7f50fda999","38ac6c528ea2216ee079ec71704a401e3059a6dd","fe4cc093d98c9f0e554751a7cb8bdfbb9730b482","f8809f8392e7250fa6ff4b514d2a1e051ef1873b","2b82b19c2208778af4198648276480c4820aa6b4","ea1445e7d77878c60ce4962c34498afcf925ea45","0f38753e093cd8cf19801eddf8569402ac8a6a61","3b806f3d0a66e358a3765b2498333c121e129fde","b4c36868b9f3ef1dd492477386efb8204f665dda","d01839086098774d820b54775d7cbc8877927734","c88096875bd7f81a47e901b4fbcc560ec07e97d9","12a8100a662291531cb3ace4fd82bbc160e737bf","f2a9cb48bea75a0f6e655b47613db7d3484a8ebc","392bb20f32a697fec7af81bfe0c3210eaf3c1687","c91ef7df37716018ab1764beaba17180fa514ca4","c41db968126de6d6ddc5511a79f1c72608ba080a","a52d9d1f3f682df4f2ad862a7e772a7cc40ae9e3","c9a6074b491ce483212d6d7ccaf1005bf32aadc1","93f5cb0e0c2d18f7996b7fc9f374aa2f148fce7f","46c17e7e6cb7b1b637c565ab4b84c89b5f7dd6f9","a175837fdd3be0f5888517ff41651bdd63ad4e73","8c3ba5fde44d44de8f00a538ffefa29208529faa","37a052c172e6eb0cf01f0bfc139f683980314dfe","29b91624d383ff3807ceca6dd82c7533f58148b3","3eaee3c84ae6f8e06ddf1d886f89dd73ef8eea73","f9dec46783ea3662b4902f506eb2764514a638b2","04ba370418fec7bde8170be66866888d564fd2c2","de831f6e1af689c82bf9c70850b6d6c8388685f7","f9d7aa5fbf70db0b56299c3cf6ed9f6216f7e1e1","a65bd82e45a3d440c4589e44020c892cdcde0e56","399e118006cf0d721b5690c33597036ffe5b2d03","8f328bb4d38c1338e14ae48ed40be19f1deef1e5","cf872f2b0f00cc90edd46d8cd3686819e07d8c24","b0ab06c9ccdcfd511f492eacb1b21c784a135968","55fc7204ccc29d03467bd8ed15c7eb025bfdd5f5","184ef0a4cd14f4d5b442144d7d2f2af10a70ceac","f91a76884db3f0014226f0400af74796074ed258","0062696e884b5459164b171d6aa5ac2f96e0e53a","e92c127889b74e12d03609ede236b985acb34418","10494dcad06c52cb5a7a6b28ebf39a59baf76132","f7c4a25d746e231df19f28d76807eb95a0c74ace","f00e64f8bba31bf8f3658ef955d6a619c44afd12","da75e401b4646d7a988754a2c9bfa65c49bdde74","4998b0b57a37e04ad0ccef9187de6d5da212d7ac","6d9043170d5bb3398ba056c4f710f84108ec262b","f69141376f78b9f86d5e662b23578ea8453b7d25","ece8d474e06722644edd829b4f5c33bb23012f0a","62b7d2319a66d18a3944ac95f9452e2440735b46","0f64ed0f9d4d90647a461f1f0846796b92ac07e0","3cff66819b22a48093745b279326202bf96918ff","09e85b42018c8aee4f3dbf167389fa3a11600771","708e4f85f1e3ecab4e50399748fb16329477e051","719682eacdda0376ad9998131257d719a0d62795","547e3ccae04af4b6b771bf861f8278596f5c8787"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Magnesium in clinical medicine.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library"}

We have therefore investigated the intercellular exchange of the fluorescent tracer molecule, Lucifer yellow, pressure-injected into the oocyte of vitellogenic follicles of Drosophila. The dye reached the nurse cells via cytoplasmic bridges and entered, via gap junctions, the somatic follicle cells covering the oocyte. The percentage of follicles showing dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells was found to increase with the developmental stage up to stage 11, but depended also on the status of oogenesis, i.e., the stage-spectrum, in the respective ovary. During late stage 10B and stage 11, dye-coupling was restricted to the follicle cells covering the anterior pole of the oocyte. No dye-coupling was observed from stage 12 onwards. During prolonged incubation in vitro, the dye was found to move from the follicle cells back into the oocyte; this process was suppressable with dinitrophenol. Dyecoupling was inhibited when prolonged in vitro incubation preceded the dye-injection. Moreover, dye-coupling was inhibited with acidic pH, low [K+], high intracellular [Ca2+], octanol, dinitrophenol, and NaN3, but not with retinoic acid, basic pH, or high extracellular [Ca2+]. Dyecoupling was stimulated with a juvenile hormone analogue and with 20-hydroxyecdysone. Thus, gap junctions between oocyte and follicle cells may play an important role in intercellular communication during oogenesis. We discuss the significance of our findings with regard to the electrophysiological properties of the follicles, and to the coordinated activities of the different cell types during follicle development and during the establishment of polarity in the follicle.","inCitations":["a13fbd68766f5b46ab9237a4c939b6e603915a86","5a00a6fe5d1bd9496c0b430363ec7be0d079bcd2","2fe072fb6c428b041883f5337e54a579924a2b99","98e1eab8252d208717efd6c041b28aab754c105f","85fbcfb0a7755c335a1f52bee352e92bc9102e9b","89e168b4952738e10023fe7cb25f4f1b8c4194b0","947ae87e7c52839081a466c985d02f3603d4ef0c","c0533ef455a0fefb7515549de5940b9f52c30011","8e2777e50a97cff8e23abd9aa708d8f5f407f714","7542a69175d580d23fe440397befc8e1b9bf6ad3","01bcef8e045281b2e7525ccdc5e0c5b345881937","a3629cc764466430a3850f0118be325907e2ca10","538e469b8a66e346af2531b42fa836dbe3c1b0dd","e039b4dbe50ff3218a1bb761e934423e3b1c2909","0efdf0aaf210f23c9fc8954d8ec4a9b6acd1418d","8220156bb392bd7966590401e9c6ea13fe516679","8b630997dad5a0a76b8c1090041e827c71455364","6c3a398ac7f6245151c9fb3054044087d1f68458","b5bab673e664a955459d14af2d85047fb7e1d8b4","4fef543d7aa49ed8d36126786cb7230c1e2681ee","af36674308521c805a25bc78b611f31bc86f83a0","1723d75fd5fdf055e0a177563a6b88756462a6c9","947ef025cd962c4b402415430620696b502c3bf1","34191317c6a1693d18d3bf5bf7a0bd81a58860a1","43a01bdd53c0e46c89ae54898ebd9bfea28e5a2d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gap junctions in ovarian follicles of Drosophila melanogaster: inhibition and promotion of dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells","doi":"10.1007/BF00304623","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00304623","venue":"Cell and Tissue Research"}

Molecules involved in the communication are potential drug targets. To identify them systematically, we applied a systems level analysis that combined reverse network engineering with causal effect estimation. Using only observational transcriptome profiles we searched for paracrine factors sending messages from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We condensed these messages to predict ten proteins that, acting in concert, cause the majority of the gene expression changes observed in HCC cells. Among the 10 paracrine factors were both known and unknown cancer promoting stromal factors, the former including Placental Growth Factor (PGF) and Periostin (POSTN), while Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPPA) was among the latter. Further support for the predicted effect of PAPPA on HCC cells came from both in vitro studies that showed PAPPA to contribute to the activation of NFκB signaling, and clinical data, which linked higher expression levels of PAPPA to advanced stage HCC. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of causal modeling in combination with a condensation step borrowed from gene set analysis [Model-based Gene Set Analysis (MGSA)] in the identification of stromal signaling molecules influencing the cancer phenotype.","inCitations":["80a971a16e1ca53a00dfba84d1fb9fc4a18bf88d","846cca7d12ad30e83bfbb235103c03b4ef2668fe","42d2f216331750af95fc6111da35154a08799ff3","ac98bdb373aa4ffed5f1ce1af44089d5fc2b97a5","13626f9c68747862fd91500c3442b98d517f889f","baff21683ee9b18fcaad0e051e986cb004e22983","5b0a83a4fd6a0e937d41e6e5d3187891f58e1766"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/69/39/pcbi.1004293.PMC4447342.pdf","https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/31890/1/journal.pcbi.1004293.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28547556"],"title":"Causal Modeling of Cancer-Stromal Communication Identifies PAPPA as a Novel Stroma-Secreted Factor Activating NFκB Signaling in Hepatocellular Carcinoma","doi":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004293","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004293","venue":"PLoS Computational Biology"}

These hydrogels contain natural cellular adhesion sites, form nanofibrous networks similar to native ECM, and are biodegradable. In this study, we expand the properties of these types of materials by incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into the ECM network. We use decellularized myocardial matrix as an example of a tissue specific ECM derived hydrogel. Myocardial matrix-PEG hybrids were synthesized by two different methods, cross-linking the proteins with an amine-reactive PEG-star and photo-induced radical polymerization of two different multi-armed PEG-acrylates. We show that both methods allow for conjugation of PEG to the myocardial matrix by gel electrophoresis and infrared spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the hybrid materials still contain a nanofibrous network similar to unmodified myocardial matrix and that the fiber diameter is changed by the method of PEG incorporation and PEG molecular weight. PEG conjugation also decreased the rate of enzymatic degradation in vitro, and increased material stiffness. Hybrids synthesized with amine-reactive PEG had gelation rates of 30 min, similar to the unmodified myocardial matrix, and incorporation of PEG did not prevent cell adhesion and migration through the hydrogels, thus offering the possibility to have an injectable ECM hydrogel that degrades more slowly in vivo. The photo-polymerized radical systems gelled in 4 min upon irradiation, allowing 3D encapsulation and culture of cells, unlike the soft unmodified myocardial matrix. This work demonstrates that PEG incorporation into ECM-based hydrogels can expand material properties, thereby opening up new possibilities for in vitro and in vivo applications.","inCitations":["2570ad35949f562163502d2dbe7e9951c97196ca","5c3576f816dc40067dde79be9e4277c6f4d453db","acc1c99e422a2e3aa383ad4211f1140590d8f137","288fa0cc4114c0e094903ccaa5bf9a9ca9b187c3","c323f5266fd75db85c7b95d5d34789b5ac57e2ae","d69eb806a2a21713b159638d0a3fcdf4c5d7bc33","583501708addc507d26e19fcaa1fc1feac749cc2","91825d3d6018db59a322a4df60c6e33ec95d162a","6c7f606db811318aabd53f959f44544d08a6d374","911f3d0ac2ebea2a8dd18d6576aa8edae98151f1","4ae30566bddae469d2d2240d87c0c1932f42c32f","b97930a7ed8cb5820134e36b4a68576b4a29f1b5","ddcf2046ff70e15cae39bfc378dc9715c67004b8","50e695eb22166c4559223b49e15d05e4c15d1b3b","6761cc6a989f4a7681d5a0f5ca975e2a433cee05","91b188e5af56e480a128103b143f48307323a1ad","dbb1956edf82a13bd9e4fc9bec6b975f5b3040aa","bd9bc4f95746f935dcec43d516c0fdfa8fe863a7","927e8082c98f7318f008a20caf949eeb4cdd8c23","b4d67a2a6ade80758610dd7ab045a0fc40307583"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Myocardial matrix-polyethylene glycol hybrid hydrogels for tissue engineering.","doi":"10.1088/0957-4484/25/1/014011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484/25/1/014011","venue":"Nanotechnology"}

Based on this work, decerebrate motor posturing and prolonged coma are not associated with brain-stem dysfunction but rather with dysfunction of the hemispheres, while absent pupillary and oculocephalic responses are correlated with brain-stem dysfunction alone. However, the accuracy with which MEP data localized human brain-stem or hemispheric dysfunction could not be confirmed by pathological correlation because of low mortality and the small number of autopsies obtained in the patients who died. Therefore, this study was undertaken in an animal model of brain-stem lesion. Complete brain-stem transections were made at the cervicomedullary junction, the medulla just caudal to the eighth nerve, and at the intercollicular region. All cortical visual evoked potential (VEP) peaks were reduced in amplitude and delayed by each of the brain stem transections, but none of the peaks was abolished. In spite of brain-stem transection, VEP's can be used to gain information about hemispheric function. Somatosensory (SEP) and auditory cortically generated evoked potentials (AEP) were abolished by these brain-stem transections, but early-latency brain-stem SEP and AEP data could accurately localize specific areas of brain-stem dysfunction caused by the lesions. Observations made on human MEP data seen to be confirmed by these animal experiments. Correlations between human and cat MEP data are discussed.","inCitations":["c9168ed6d952fd865135873768bcaf0e8cdda173","ee648114164c1a2891eb96a2ff13ad1fa65ea978","9c9dcebf27245f4ba5f2c1087ff1d1c70104de0b","c568d46a5d95546d93a1e4dfd4ec0ad649625b91","03a26aa628bb0be882a2760d029050fcfe7a18b6","730c9c4342ba3476b692658baca145436dbd8d20","a89d40e8173620205dd21e99307fa1e904e9ce7d","da2610ee9add10d9f8f6e07f13f4740663cad5cc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Noninvasive localization of brain-stem lesions in the cat with multimodality evoked potentials: correlation with human head-injury data.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of neurosurgery"}

Fluorescence emissions were measured with a monochromator and a photomultiplier tube. Intact tendons and elastic ligaments had a strong fluorescence emission peak around 440 to 450 nm and only weak fluorescence around 510 nm. Tissues such as lean meat and adipose tissue that contain a matrix of reticular fibers (Type III collagen) had very low fluorescence around 440 to 450 nm so that their peak emittance was the weak fluorescence peak at 510 nm. The 510/440 nm ratio of fluorescence emissions was measured in comminuted meat samples containing varying mixtures of lean meat and gristle and varying mixtures of muscles with a high and low gristle content. The 510/440 nm ratio was correlated with the ratio of lean meat/gristle (r = .96, P less than .005). The 510/440 nm ratio was correlated with the ratio of longissimus/shank meat (two trials; r = .93, P less than .01; and r = .94, P less than .005). Results were only slightly changed when samples had dry surfaces or when samples were mixed with adipose particles. The relationship between the area of gristle in the samples and the 510/440 nm ratio was curvilinear with the greatest sensitivity to the fewest gristle fragments.","inCitations":["8f0f0e08e24a3f8505a87319695151b77b7e2274","287c38836312d2e19901e9edec2c7ebc6ab62b49","432fa5ab4f6ae36ad742064a17f2a8943c522bac","14786337b310eed063fbf77494d1588dc07a18ad","bf9ab14aa158812ded9e33b305800a0f33039665"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Measurement of the gristle content in beef by macroscopic ultraviolet fluorimetry.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of animal science"}

It is recommended that pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas receive at least two doses of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. This study assessed the prevalence of placental malaria at delivery in women during 1st or 2nd pregnancy, who did not receive intermittent preventive treatment for malaria (IPTp) in a malaria-endemic area with high bed net coverage. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was done in Ifakara, Tanzania, where bed net coverage is high. Primi- and secundigravid women, who presented to the labour ward and who reported not using IPTp were included in the study. Self-report data were collected by questionnaire; whereas neonatal birth weight and placenta parasitaemia were measured directly at the time of delivery. Overall, 413 pregnant women were enrolled of which 91% reported to have slept under a bed net at home the previous night, 43% reported history of fever and 62% were primigravid. Malaria parasites were detected in 8% of the placenta samples; the geometric mean (95%CI) placental parasite density was 3,457 (1,060–11,271) parasites/μl in primigravid women and 2,178 (881–5,383) parasites/μl in secundigravid women. Fifteen percent of newborns weighed <2,500 g at delivery. Self-reported bed net use was statistically associated with lower risk for low birth weight [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.16–0.74) and OR 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08–0.59) for untreated and treated bed nets, respectively], but was not associated with placental parasitaemia [OR 0.74 (0.21–2.68) and OR 1.64 (0.44–6.19) for untreated and treated bed nets, respectively]. The observed incidence of LBW and prevalence of placental parasitaemia at delivery suggests that malaria remains a problem in pregnancy in this area with high bed net coverage when eligible women do not receive IPTp. Delivery of IPTp should be emphasized at all levels of implementation to achieve maximum community coverage.","inCitations":["6509674077aa0dcad4de8d9153afb8cce55ebf85","c6ed18ac24739420621c635527fbe11fc0f7b0b8","25709a0cbf8ec69c5c8732ce89f72433a4dbd412","2929d1db54456cefe4391bf8e3b5b07b5403911a","7731fad4520b7884ff7bcc30557b5d797302b932","5fad8d20f29c8d391fd674a68bb60d18377438b9","85a2090be4f0b53aacac192ccf5af970c4905e8e","3467ca514dc8db66ecd311afd8d56cbea12c592b","0c010b1f97fcd1977b8eba9e90d42d783743087f","d8f11eeabb74f1618a6fa289d5357201069649ce","8b9c4879c5a8441d0ca0f46d6f5c63f9daecfa88","cd0099a04d0720e50fc4b286fa94c3c14d17f074","1851f7aa07dc7e4222e6633ba30600a779a6e83a","1c05c82f3e24a764266b970b90c36afde1f19f7c","9a64ecc1e8dc401d3b3df321f9138143fcf163e7","e3a0b6fefc5da8a131027beb446a8dc4cde74f6e","a96d353dc2548bd7be46e39c90ec9d7cbf63bcbb","f87b84cb5904c1c18445580b1ee00361fc83a20f"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/d4/48/Malar_J_2008_Jul_21_7_133.tar.gz","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1475-2875-7-133&originUrl=http://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1475-2875-7-133","http://ihi.eprints.org/124/1/1475-2875-7-133.pdf"],"title":"Malaria in pregnant women in an area with sustained high coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets","doi":"10.1186/1475-2875-7-133","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-7-133","venue":"Malaria Journal"}

Following a single-step liquid-liquid extraction, the analytes and internal standard (zaleplon) were separated using an isocratic mobile phase on a reversed-phase C18 column. The lower limit of quantitation was 3 ng/mL for zopiclone and 6 ng/mL for desmethylzopiclone with a relative standard deviation of less than 5%. A linear dynamic range of 3-300 ng/mL for zopiclone and of 6-500 ng/mL for desmethylzopiclone was established. This HPLC method was validated with between-batch precision of 1.7-4.2% and 3.2-7.5% for zopiclone and desmethylzopiclone respectively. The between-batch accuracy was 99.4-111.5% and 101.6-104.8% for zopiclone and desmethylzopiclone, respectively. Frequently coadministered drugs did not interfere with the described methodology. Stability of zopiclone and desmethylzopiclone in plasma was excellent, with no evidence of degradation during sample processing (autosampler) and 30 days' storage in a freezer. This validated method is simple and repeatable enough to be used in pharmacokinetic studies.","inCitations":["ccc01eba386c77eacceb0ff616f35455065df9c9","84b2a181cd626b7976fa34cfabc3a9ff7e062577","eb3e0b24fd788a9f8ede40a7d6d91048eb268907","07cb87fe9c4170bb4beb4d4f6a6a8d02936c7660"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitation of zopiclone and desmethylzopiclone in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography using fluorescence detection.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Biomedical chromatography : BMC"}

Such analysis is typically facilitated by a hodgepodge of procedural code and scripts representing heuristics to be applied, and configuration databases representing state. As entities in the data center and relationships among them change, it is a challenge to keep the analysis tools up-to-date. We describe a framework that is based primarily on the principle of interpreting declarative representations of knowledge rather than capturing such knowledge in procedural code, and a variety of techniques for facilitating the continuous update of knowledge and state. A metamodel representing data center-specific domain knowledge forms the foundation for the framework. A model of the data center topological elements is an instantiation of the metamodel. Using the framework, we present a methodology for conducting a variety of analyses as a model-driven topology subgraph traversal, governed by knowledge embedded in the corresponding metamodel nodes. We apply the methodology to perform root cause analysis of performance problems in the domains of 3-tier Web and InfoSphere Streams applications.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2013.98"],"title":"An Ontology-Based Framework for Model-Driven Analysis of Situations in Data Centers","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2013.98","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2013.98","venue":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing"}

In direct titrimetry (method A), aqueous solution of SBS is titrated with chloramine-T(CAT) in hydrochloric acid medium and in the presence of excess of potassium bromide, using methyl orange indicator. Back titrimetry(method B) involves treating of SBS with a measured excess of chloramine-T in hydrochloric acid medium, and after the oxidation of SBS is judged to be complete, the unreacted oxidant is determined iodometrically, In both methods, the reaction follows a 1:2 (SBS:CAT), reaction stoichiometry method A is applicable over 2.5-9.5 mg, and 3-10 mg of SBS can be determined by method B. Spectrophotometric methods entail the addition of a known excess of CAT to SBS in hydrochloric acid medium followed by determination of residual oxidant by reacting with a fixed amount of either methyl orange and measuring the absorbance at 520 nm (Method C) or indigo carmine and measuring the absorbance at 610 nm (Method D). In all the methods, the amount of CAT reacted corresponds to the amount of SBS. In spectrophotometric methods, the systems obey Beer’s law for 0.5-4.5 and 1.25-12.5 μg/ml for method C and method D, respectively. Apparent molar absorptivity values are calculated to be 6.89×104 (method A) and 2.46×104 l/mol/cm (method B). The limits of detection and quantification are reported for both methods. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy of the developed methods were evaluated. The methods were successfully applied to the assay of SBS in tablet and capsule formulations and the results were compared with those of a reference method by applying Student’s t-and F-tests. No interference was observed from common tablet adjuvants.  2006 Trade Science Inc. INDIA Web Publication Date : 10th June, 2006 Trade Science Inc.

The algorithmic improvements reduce the complexity by up to 56% compared to prior art. At the same time estimator shows great improvement in speed, allowing over 6 times the number of estimations in the same time. Power consumption of the estimator is simulated to ~ 20 mW, running at 70 MHz.","inCitations":["049cb22267834e021e9e707f9fb5a2d3057d2d95","e3fd8cef45d55e516554121ce2e19c7f21d6c0ba","1d87aa4cfb550c21e4e116b819203acff97a3f19","2f6b4fe38bad1a57358d26555b8a706cd49a99e9","cbf05a2ba36fa295cc62441ae0da0a4f7716e897","c5d42e43bf6ae7522c1a84c2a74eee3543024bc1","2ac26a1a9359f617dc52816a357415ff088859d6","c4dfe04b8bdaa613d802628c571a6231f3922c85","0610862178be0b1e293a5c1f263b298576ef3add"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2264695"],"title":"Improved Matching-Pursuit Implementation for LTE Channel Estimation","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2264695","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2264695","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers"}

They demand complex adjustments in the cardiovascular system to offset the decrease in cardiac filling pressure. Such changes are necessary to sustain arterial blood pressure at an appropriate level so that there is adequate perfusion of vital organs, especially the brain. These adjustments must compensate for both the initial and sustained orthostatic stress. The rapid short-term adaptations are mediated primarily by the cardiovascular reflexes with humoral agents reinforcing these reflexes during severe and prolonged orthostatic stress. Understanding these complex reflex adjustments in normal humans is necessary in order to appreciate subjects with orthostatic intolerance.","inCitations":["7af5cc76c3d9ff8df515b505bbbb5d59f8a7c6ad","fc47964ae59b293b91fc3d875124203c7fc9e8b4","8083b1f23231aa163c71e2ad7b5a168c58d4bffe","dd5c5169f5c4600337833b66e4f0c6cbb59a33aa","c47bf69a2fc2fc03c241f1b7fafe96a0ee7d158c","fbf7d9f49a00d04ffb4658858fe90cbcfda496a4","e7ca6f8b9b333134243a06a3a5ca4d97a4a33589","7e5ce2416047c062436c47844f0327db86c1dffd","34ecce5ee11b559ca7bb97a25af1783983a20c00","bb5c2e0f32ad14a7190bb6316970dc46ec680b18","9de0b21769687c96534fe8fbe106458204a82224","08bcce9a3aba03479ae0427004a7dafab2165b38","a51624893c78d84f46eba7fc97567db78c208d37"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Initial and delayed circulatory responses to orthostatic stress in normal humans and in subjects with orthostatic intolerance.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology"}

After electrophoresis together with molecular length standards, the DNA is neutralized, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and the density profiles recorded with a computer controlled scanner. The median lengths, number average molecular lengths, and length average molecular lengths of the DNAs can be computed by using the mobilities of the molecular length standards. The frequency of single strand breaks can then be determined by comparison of the corresponding average molecular lengths of DNAs treated and not treated with single strand break-inducing agents (radiation, chemicals, or lesion-specific endonuclease). Single strand break yields (induced at pyrimidine dimer sites in uv-irradiated human fibroblasts DNA by the dimer-specific endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus) from our method agree with values obtained for the same DNAs from alkaline sucrose gradient analysis. The method has been used to determine pyrimidine dimer yields in DNA from biopsies of human skin irradiated in situ. It will be especially useful in determining the frequency of single strand breaks (or lesions convertible to single strand breaks by specific cleaving reagents or enzymes) in small quantities of DNA from cells or tissues not amenable to radioactive labeling.","inCitations":["59a675d8b7b7e6d7e72db661ac9631b0b37cd1ef","858a5221761e6c7a20f51501f2080e579ed92d14","35e4c22061afc0448753c0c73c059f97b959cd9c","2c5cd12379366d6d7be06198c79a091b2617e332","43b68484dac1173cd74e841ba3b3390f79c14c64","53e7ba69b268ba7b371861ca2287d4f93bb686a8","57cdcb4262006d232a8d65193fea9870b8f962d6","0d1dedc77af9fefbd3697579d35f1654821ff1ca","a6abe22caf94c7f1d4b1ce5c3306e3640c51cc67","161fa5c60fd1a99c4386a9a5609badea94e66528","7626949fab79f83b61e85cb55e097f6da2e648bc","8e363668a16e127f57fc3cd8c85530b8ef141e7d","8b8b3fd3a45009526c0272ac1aae95193fcc7ecc","b83cefab3f4f2f2ded0de1ca85aa74b25416b5a8","059377815919b7802f4bd0cd449bf40d016ed621","469223bf2f4e753349f31ce3b8de00418fd421ab","df1add13286697d940161375e897947693c34bfd","d533e0fec6873246a08b21d46579a0795016db75","0bd6641f5c76f5fc7c1f43e12172e818926b0294","b3d043e6cf7eab629ca086e2af35b0d6d507cfd2","34cae0b0d078340f70f4c4cf37ff618bf03bd3dc","404279f940bc46da9b553e3e0847f717ae28b6ae","b6f8b3ff41fca9d49624278f387248b1d9f66cf0","ca01018fb797df097dfaa34b63483bf90ab88c22","eb272962041cbe60a465a5bf7c6fad48c44029ef","28f94d346e76268dabc5f12ec41dd9fe2cec1c4c","04a0f8182ddf071e74ee93746457e45ce09939b9","6960de8b7d4b7adcd14c7413d779280c660b33d4","f204ba6b1ad88afbfac9251e2fec4b4a0301cfe3","34cbcc59161146ddc2e97813bceec60f0cf3198f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitation of radiation-, chemical-, or enzyme-induced single strand breaks in nonradioactive DNA by alkaline gel electrophoresis: application to pyrimidine dimers.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Analytical biochemistry"}

Less invasive biomarkers tested so far predict risk for one event or the other, not both. We prospectively tested blood and urine monthly for 12 months posttransplant from children receiving a kidney transplant. The IDO enzyme pathway was assessed by MS assays using the ratio of product l-kyn to substrate trp. Kyn/trp ratios and blood CD4 T-cell ATP levels were correlated with acute rejection or major infection events or stable group (no events) in the next 30 days. The 25 subjects experienced six discrete episodes of acute rejection in five subjects and 16 discrete events of major infection in 14 subjects (seven BK viruria, six cytomegaloviremia, one EB and cytomegaloviremia, and two transplant pyelonephritis). Mean serum kyn/trp ratios were significantly elevated in the group that experienced acute rejection (p = 0.02). Within-subject analyses revealed that over time, urine kyn/trp ratios showed an increase (p = 0.01) and blood CD4-ATP levels showed a decrease (p = 0.007) prior to a major infection event. These pilot results suggest that a panel of biomarkers together can predict over- or under-immunosuppression, but need independent validation.","inCitations":["2088ee6a735f52411ef607b97f88bca78723bed2","2d161827928960b0f64cc6da84ac04622d6a0e52"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immune biomarker panel monitoring utilizing IDO enzyme activity and CD4 ATP levels: prediction of acute rejection vs. viral replication events.","doi":"10.1111/j.1399-3046.2011.01485.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3046.2011.01485.x","venue":"Pediatric transplantation"}

How does the ability to ignore sexual distractors evolve with age? To answer these questions, two experiments using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) were conducted. Experiment 1 showed that both younger and older participants were better at identifying a target (the name of a colour) when it was preceded by 336 ms by a sexual word rather than by a musical word. Strikingly, the sexual-word advantage was more pronounced for older adults than for younger adults. Experiment 2 showed that introducing a variable delay between the distractor and the target eliminated the sexual-word advantage. This finding suggests that the sexual-word advantage found in Experiment 1 was due to learning to utilize the sexual word as a temporal cue with a fixed duration between the distractor and the target. Contrary to previous research [Arnell et al., 2007, Emotion, 7, 465), neither experiment showed that sexual words produce an attentional blink.","inCitations":["62d645bf2e99f4e1f9f67c5b4772df4e101a9aec"],"pdfUrls":["http://psychologie.univ-fcomte.fr/download/section-psychologie/document/pdf/didierjean-etalbjp2013.pdf","http://psychologie.univ-fcomte.fr/download/section-psychologie/document/pdf/bjp2013.pdf","http://psychologie.univ-fcomte.fr/download/section-psychologie/document/pdf/bjp2014.pdf"],"title":"Sexual distractors boost younger and older adults' visual search RSVP performance.","doi":"10.1111/bjop.12023","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12023","venue":"British journal of psychology"}

Thermal exchange was measured using a direct calorimeter consisting of a recording bath and a reference bath, both of which were filled with water at 18 degree C. The subject immersed the two distal phalanx of a finger into the recording bath. The water thermal gradient between both baths after 4 min of finger immersion and the maximal value of heat loss from the finger to the water were recorded. Decreases in the water thermal gradient (from 6.06 to 5.33 degrees C, P less than 0.05) in maximal value of heat loss (from 22.5 to 18.75 w.m-2, P less than 0.01) and in plethysmographic wave amplitude (from 25.8 to 14.6 mm, P less than 0.01) and increased HR (from 72 to 83 beats min-1) were observed in smokers. These changes were not statistically significant in non-smokers. Water thermal gradient and maximal value of heat loss correlated with plethysmographic wave amplitude before and after smoking but not with HR in the 24 subjects studied. The present study shows a good relationship between vascular phenomena and thermal exchange in the fingers. The variations of finger pulse amplitude provide an adequate and sensitive adjustment of thermal exchange since the effects of smoking a single cigarette can be detected by both PWA and calorimetric measurements in the finger.","inCitations":["37656cbea40478bacbbe266da41032a2f067d91d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Relationship between pulse amplitude and thermal exchange in the finger: the effect of smoking.","doi":"10.1111/j.1475-097X.1986.tb00062.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-097X.1986.tb00062.x","venue":"Clinical physiology"}

Its objective is to supply the driver with important information found on traffic signs. This information could be speed limits, traffic orders (Stop, for example) or texts that describe the nature of the road ahead. In this paper, a four-stage text recognition strategy is investigated. The first stage uses Histogram of Oriented gradients (HOG) features in combination with a trained suppervector machine (SVM) to detect traffic signs, specifically text-based signs such as speed-limit signs or informative-signs describing traffic situations. The detection stage is followed by a filtering stage. This stage aims to 'clean' the detected traffic sign using some filters. The filters tested in this paper are the Grayscale filter, Bilateral filter, Median filtered, and the Gaussian filler. The filtered image is then fed into the third stage, the recognition stage. An open-source Optical Character Recognition tool (OCR) \"Tesseract\" is used to read the texts found on the detected traffic signs. The strategy concludes with a fourth stage, i.e., post- processing, in order to add a layer of immunity to false positive and false readings. Finally, we compare our work to the standard HOG-SVM scheme. The results show that our scheme exhibits a higher accuracy over the HOG-SVM scheme.","inCitations":["1f409568dc3058022ae3edc32d760a193701a13b","9cf5a6270e3339667ea3bda11268b554c953edaf","ac7e1b463028e8f5a2cbe2e861052b2b18a3bd1c","b6bee0dfbdfd2ce16567a36cf495001e6e7e2b24","b38af39921b8fdbd862257a4f4e8fb3cb53cb75b","ca9c48997f858d54e1216cc560aa54026e40ec4d","db6ea4e9db00fbf9801adf64d977309fe4695e17","4094f0acf4af2d09250154a8e59b907378902df0","3b7ee9458b64b6391994bfa201959d60377a480d","452945c4c1556c3de81587c849c3462348bf3145","961d1927c4b09ea803b36bd8ff6253b60f04bd2a","1424a3f568d74ae95ada27e94a2d6b23d34662dc","360686764e1c34f2aa1695cce65cbc9278adda5c","038b3cf9ba6894cd001ae57125f2fdbfcf0743b0"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966161"],"title":"Road-Sign Text Recognition Architecture for Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966161","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966161","venue":"2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)"}

Correlations between local atomic/electronic structure and thermoelectric properties are investigated by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The spectroscopic results indicate that as Ge is partially substituted onto Si sites at x ≤ 0.05, Co in CoSi1−xGex gains a certain amount of charge in its 3d orbitals. Contrarily, upon further replacing Si with Ge at x ≥ 0.05, the Co 3d orbitals start to lose some of their charge. Notably, thermopower is strongly correlated with charge redistribution in the Co 3d orbital, and the observed charge transfer between Ge and Co is responsible for the variation of Co 3d occupancy number. In addition to Seebeck coefficient, which can be modified by tailoring the Co 3d states, local lattice disorder may also be beneficial in enhancing the thermoelectric properties. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrum results further demonstrate that the lattice phonons can be enhanced by Ge doping, which results in the formation of the disordered Co-Co pair. Improvements in the thermoelectric properties are interpreted based on the variation of local atomic and electronic structure induced by lattice distortion through chemical substitution. Copyright c © EPLA, 2014 Introduction. – At present, energy crisis and extreme climate are two of the most pressing global issues believed to be related to the rise in carbon dioxide emission. Sunlight is a clean, renewable, and abundant energy resource that can be converted into electricity through a solar cell, wherein solar energy excites the cell’s electrons. Utilizing solar energy is one of the best ways to generate green energy. To date, the highest performance efficiency attained by commercial solar cells varies between 10% to 20%, with a substantial portion of energy lost due to heat loss to the environment. The problem is how to fully utilize the waste heat and make the use of solar energy more efficient. Solar cells only absorb a certain (a)E-mail: clchen@phys.sinica.edu.tw (b)E-mail: dong.cl@nsrrc.org.tw wavelength of sunlight, but heat has no such restrictions. Thus, thermoelectric materials that can convert temperature gradient into thermal induced current may be promising candidates for energy applications [1]. Transition metal silicides with semi-metallic or semiconducting properties have drawn much attention due to their applications in thermoelectric materials [2–5]. Silicides exhibit great stability and chemical resistance to oxidation or acidification due to their strong covalent bonding, making them more suitable for a practical range of applications, including those performed in high temperature. Among silicides, cobalt monosilicide CoSi is regarded as a highpotential candidate for thermoelectric applications [6–8]. CoSi is a semi-metal, and band structure calculations have shown the presence of a narrow gap, also known as pseudogap, at the Fermi level in its density of states (DOS).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://tkuir.lib.tku.edu.tw:8080/dspace/retrieve/82172/0295-5075_106_3_37007.pdf"],"title":"Effect of local atomic and electronic structures on thermoelectric properties of chemically substituted CoSi","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For this reason in the next years more and more Online Social Networks (OSNs) will move to the new H.265 HEVC standard[15].\n It is widely known that Pixel Non Uniformity (PNU) noise can be exploited to identify the camera that acquired an image applying the method introduced by Fridrich et al. [16]. The same technique has been adapted to identify video DVs source camera. Unfortunately the noise present in a digital image heavily depends on the compression level used to store it and high (lossy) compression algorithms, can completely filter out any kind of noise.\n In this paper we analyze the effects of H.265 encoding on PNU noise, to prove under which conditions it still can be exploited for Source Camera Identification (SCI) for DV.

Surprisingly, the TIPS investigators imply priority for proposing a polypill from a 2002 publication. This is incorrect: we detailed the polypill 2 years earlier and cited the source in 2003. Also, we did not claim that “reductions in risk factors were independent of initial levels”. We showed that absolute and proportional blood pressure changes and absolute cholesterol changes vary with pretreatment level but that proportional cholesterol changes do not. Cholesterol and blood pressure reductions in TIPS were smaller than our 2003 estimates. We believe our estimates are correct. They were based on average pretreatment LDL cholesterol (4·8 mmol/L) and blood pressure (150/90 mm Hg) in people who develop cardiovascular disease, the group relevant to quantifying disease prevention; corresponding values in TIPS were lower (3·0 mmol/L, 135/86 mm Hg). Lower pretreatment cholesterol, lower simvastatin dose (20 mg not 40 mg), and nonadherence to prescribed therapy can explain the smaller LDL cholesterol reduction in TIPS (0·70 mmol/L). Blood pressure reductions on the polycap in TIPS (7·4/5·6 mm Hg) were 42% (diastolic) and 53% (systolic), smaller than expected after allowing for pretreatment blood pressure and non-adherence. This seems an anomalous TIPS result rather than an overestimated expectation, since the blood pressure reductions in groups allocated one, two, or three bloodpressure-lowering drugs confi rm additive eff ects of each drug and were only about 2·5/1·5 mm Hg per drug— less than that seen in meta-analysis of randomised trials. The small reductions in cholesterol (explained) and blood pressure (unexplained) in TIPS both underestimate the health benefi ts of a polypill.","inCitations":["8104d847bc9355e844887dc9abd3fdfaa00018ad","61117b555b3f2d1cd62581c42ce010bb101ef23c","be0e4e146d57af440c377e70c357ed644be53cd1"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673609615865","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673609615865?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"The Indian Polycap Study (TIPS)","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61586-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61586-5","venue":"The Lancet"}

Laser desorption mass spectrometry of the purified pigment demonstrates the presence of heme. Examination of purified pigment under polarized light microscopy illuminates ordered birefringent crystals. Field emission in lens scanning electron microscopy reveals irregular ovoid crystals of 200-300 nm in diameter. The purified pigment crystals seeded extension of monomeric heme onto the crystal which by Fourier Transform Infrared analysis is beta-hematin. Rediae of a second echinostome parasite, Echinostoma caproni, from experimentally infected Biomphalaria glabrata, do not produce measurable or recoverable heme crystals. These observations are consistent with heme crystal formation by a hematophagous parasite within a non-vertebrate intermediate host.","inCitations":["56764cd1329cf7b2954b7497217694111e933203","35547cf9bdd9ac14f358437bb4c37b631fd54ab9","2628d8314993ecd0364d70d832bbf8a52b4c4f17","22536274524264cd7f498d9daca34534973bc326","42ad475a80a57b0f384ee4316ad25f21d47c99cd","fcb2587979eed75eccdbf50ae9a1dc0629e59ec2","c6d5ecd7f09e04016537baab8ff3875a805f40b8","ed348b3ae3cf1c0b4dd7a716b8253b766c0c271a","0ced2ffceda094f686a7526141ca3d7f61dafe60","46902b0c48aa9e77778a7cd2bd5d5862d0a1f95a","3a5e9fd486747bbd53987d928e296a28d61fac7a","050d7b7a72c4cb24b2ea6f4b1d04a40f4ff61040","f602df24a32bbe5c6a22525d19b0cae6c2e3445e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hemozoin formation in Echinostoma trivolvis rediae.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"International journal for parasitology"}

In this context, workplace training plays an essential role for the harmony of interdependence between community and company. This paper provides a top-down analysis of training effects and a model for an empirical evaluation of explanatory variables for training intensity in the case of a multinational telecommunications company. The analysis of training effects revealed that there are important motivational, social and functional benefits for the employee. Empirical results were dependent on the calculation method of training intensity. Thus, the percentage of employees from a subsidiary, which participates in a training program, is related to the degree of market development but not to the average labour productivity. Nevertheless, when training intensity is expressed as the number of hours of training compared to the total person-hours worked, there is empirical evidence that both labour productivity and market development can be accepted as explanatory variables. The examination of results has highlighted significant discrepancies in personnel training between developed countries and less developed ones.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.amfiteatrueconomic.ro/temp/Article_1020.pdf"],"title":"An Evaluation of Explanatory Variables for a Telecommunications Company Amfiteatru Economic 132 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO TRAIN THEIR PERSONNEL .

In healthy snakes, DNA fragmentation and cell death usually affect a few circulating erythrocytes in agreement with the long life span expected for these cells. In the present study we investigated whether infection by Hepatozoon spp. affected the incidence of DNA fragmentation and cell death in erythrocytes from the rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus terrificus. Methods such as the kinetics of Feulgen-DNA hydrolysis, and the TUNEL and comet assays, previously used for the study of chromatin organization and DNA fragmentation in erythrocytes of healthy snakes, were used. The results indicated that Hepatozoon spp. increased the DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation typical of cell death in circulating erythrocytes of C. d. terrificus, including cells that do not harbour the parasite. The Hepatozoon infection is thus suggested to accelerate destruction of erythrocytes in the rattlesnake, not only affecting cells harbouring the parasite, but also in those without it.","inCitations":["91e8bb91ffefeda8768f3945f35baa64354dd7d1","efdc7bd85f8a273e04b7e758609f6fbf775ada35"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chromatin supraorganization, DNA fragmentation, and cell death in erythrocytes of the rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus terrificus (Serpentes, Viperidae), infected with the protozoan, Hepatozoon spp. (Apicomplexa, Hepatozoidae).","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cell biology international"}

Important aspects of a person's capacity for recovery are the person's own understanding of the illness and the ability to use this understanding to manage the illness. The aim of this study is to describe how individuals with major depression understand their illness and use their understanding to handle it. Twenty participants treated in community care for major depression as determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were interviewed between February and June, 2008. Content analysis of the interviews revealed three major themes: (1) awakening insight, (2) strategies for understanding and managing, and (3) making use of understanding, each with additional subthemes. Individual understandings of the illness varied and led to differences in the ways participants were able to handle their depression. In clinical care it is essential to support an individual's understanding of depression and his or her use of that understanding to handle the illness.","inCitations":["112b2917c8fc7a1683b6d1d86f1ec49bf4542dc3","582b1db6f583cc2b05ba7dc9564eb90692180ab8","46205834ac59cc9e60cceb29beff9d6f2307e14a","7f80f4b5fe72b6da12e8ce654959e27a724c12d1","1811877c56e8c90639335bb3ba8b7ee4f6a597a4","0f7e2f0daeb97ede3d42fb10afbe9019b73554d7","5ac1e1f00f89ec119e40563d150c80522f1337ae"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experiences of major depression: individuals' perspectives on the ability to understand and handle the illness.","doi":"10.3109/01612840.2011.653038","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/01612840.2011.653038","venue":"Issues in mental health nursing"}

The purpose of this study was to identify patients with poor adherence to antihypertensive therapy and compare the levels of adherence with daily dose frequency of antihypertensive therapy [Single Daily Dose (SDD), Twice-Daily Dose (BID), and doses of more than twice daily (> BID)]. A cross sectional study was conducted on a convenience sampling of 518 patients with antihypertensive therapy at the Clinic of General Hospital of Penang, Malaysia. Adherence was assessed using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). The one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the means of three categorical independent variable (SDD, BID and > BID), and one continuous dependent variable scores ranging from 1 (adherence) to 5 (poor adherence). Our results show that, the MORISKY scale items were summed that 195 patients had poor adherence to hypertensive medication. According to this result, 51.3% of our total sample was taking their medicines irregularly. Also we found a significant relationship between daily dose frequency groups and adherence at level p< 0.001. It shows that hypertension patients groups, who have more daily dose frequency, will show higher level of adherence towards antihypertensive medications.","inCitations":["bae0eeeab9437b0dedf1f680e5c52615c0a3de61","9dccbbff0a81333bf00ed3a9f9a4cf31949891f2","965f3fc0f702f6608ee5496baceed0f82f085b8a","fc74cf8ee914f6131d7acf14f4b08da53246cd30","1c24ae4fac802a21fe7f8bf77fa373011adc2b19","fc5a6bf1ccab9487caf40697655710f69065e538","f686dc2180920a7790bb7ff4240c121cc6cbff5a"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.ju.edu.jo/JJPS/article/viewFile/752/751"],"title":"Adherence to Antihypertensive Therapy in General Hospital of Penang:Does Daily Dose Frequency Matter?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

On the other hand, such gains are attainable only by instituting detailed action plans at both the organizational and program level. Given this need, the paucity of research papers related to planning, and in particular, optimized planning is surprising. This research, which is aimed at this gap, brings out an application of optimization for the planning of reusable software components (SCs). We present a model that selects a set of SCs that must be built, in order to lower development and adaptation costs. We also provide implications to project management based on simulation, an approach that has been adopted by other cost models in the software engineering literature.

A good functional capacity often predicts low risk, and MPI for diagnosing CAD should be reserved for individuals with poor exercise capacity, abnormal resting electrocardiography, or an intermediate or high probability of CAD. With respect to anatomy-based testing, coronary CT angiography has a good negative predictive value, but stenosis severity correlates poorly with ischemia. Therefore decision making with respect to revascularization may be limited when a purely noninvasive anatomical test is used. Regarding perfusion imaging, the diagnostic accuracies of SPECT, PET, and cardiac magnetic resonance are similar, though fewer studies are available with cardiac magnetic resonance. PET coronary flow reserve may offer a negative predictive value sufficiently high to exclude severe CAD such that patients with mild to moderate reversible perfusion defects can forego invasive angiography. In addition, combined anatomical and perfusion-based imaging may eventually offer a definitive evaluation for diagnosing CAD, even in higher risk patients. Any remarkable findings on single-photon emission computed tomography and PET MPI studies are valuable for prognostication. Furthermore, assessment of myocardial blood flow with PET is particularly powerful for prognostication as it reflects the end result of many processes that lead to atherosclerosis. Decision making with respect to revascularization is limited for cardiac MRI and PET MPI. In contrast, retrospective radionuclide studies have identified an ischemic threshold, but randomized trials are needed. In patients with at least moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function, viable myocardium as assessed by PET or MRI, appears to identify patients who benefit from revascularization, but well-executed randomized trials are lacking.","inCitations":["d17a9ab7bb37aeac062ec387d609a945cb9b5164","850e70fa8d4d7d0eb0dd62182127d6d241005590","9ad754d474f5c543dd862b309d21d20099d351ee","90bdbc93d5a9ccbfec9a738a130e9d5925bc9dcf","8cbc2c1bdd5cd2288c3292364ed267f77d3a3f91","67c3971c99f9a96e95639fb0b6c48dd8484f0c6e","c070346181e18cf9868a11bed6fb7dc0153bfaaa","8794750ef1f33b9e560b77385a66bd5cdf52929a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clinical decision making with myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.","doi":"10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2014.04.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2014.04.006","venue":"Seminars in nuclear medicine"}

One reflector type has a plasmonic grating that is embedded in the ZnO layer; the other one has a metallic grating patterned on top of the Ag layer. From comparing the short-circuit current densities of the two device types, we conclude that light trapping through grating coupling is more efficient than coupling of light through the excitation of localized surface plasmons. The back reflectors were patterned with dot arrays by evaporation of Ag through millimeter-size stencil membranes. The stencils themselves were patterned by wafer-scale nanosphere lithography. The dot arrays have a periodicity of 428 nm and efficiently scatter light in the near-infrared wavelength range. Both back reflectors types lead to the same morphology for the silicon films. This allows us a fair comparison of the two light coupling mechanisms. We found a 14% and 19% short-circuit current density enhancement for the plasmonic and for the metallic grating, respectively. The external quantum efficiency gains between 550 and 650 nm show similar guided modes resonances for both device types, but the excitation is stronger for the device with the metallic grating.","inCitations":["04e50c11166efda0130c0307b4a5c6a1466f6ad6","7c8514a54c2004fa61d9fdfafbc5ddb52eb0a38a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stencil-Nanopatterned Back Reflectors for Thin-Film Amorphous Silicon n-i-p Solar Cells","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics"}

Health education and PN programs that increase awareness of the benefits of getting a colonoscopy may encourage colonoscopy completion.

However, managing firewall rules, particularly in multi-firewall enterprise networks, has become a complex and error-prone task. Firewall filtering rules have to be written, ordered and distributed carefully in order to avoid firewall policy anomalies that might cause network vulnerability. Therefore, inserting or modifying filtering rules in any firewall requires thorough intraand inter-firewall analysis to determine the proper rule placement and ordering in the firewalls. In this chapter, we identify all anomalies that could exist in a singleor multi-firewall environment. We also present a set of techniques and algorithms to automatically discover policy anomalies in centralized and distributed legacy firewalls. These techniques are implemented in a software tool called the “Firewall Policy Advisor” that simplifies the management of filtering rules and maintains the security of next-generation firewalls.","inCitations":["c844988ada316314e671a3590d8cf53398db3453","bf8818951e11e5b5219a9b1ca2b8fe16c928fa06","2adb4cf78766b9d8b7b88a835702ef5485a93205","2f77d8ec1a277cdf2a7a14e50c21d614d532865d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10371-6"],"title":"Automated Firewall Analytics","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-10371-6","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10371-6","venue":"Springer International Publishing"}

Consequently, the value of the capacitance varies with the voltage level, frequency and magnitude of the charging/discharging current. Conventional RC models or ladder RC network models are not apt for accurate representation of such dynamics. This paper investigates the suitability of a simple fractional order model for accurately representing such characteristics of the supercapacitors for pulse power applications. The identification of the fractional order model parameters from constant resistance charge/discharge test, constant current charge/discharge test and impedance spectroscopy is discussed. Based on the test results, the shortcomings of the simple fractional order model in representing the pulse power applications, owing to the variation of the fractional order model parameters are examined.

We verify which hydrodynamic theory would be most appropriate for different ocean depths. The linear and nonlinear shallow water wave equations in describing tsunami wave propagation are compared for the China Sea. There is a critical zone between 400 and 500 m depth for employing linear and nonlinear models. Furthermore, the bottom frictional term exerts a noticeable influence on the propagation of the nonlinear waves in shallow water. We also apply different models based on these characteristics for forecasting potential seismogenic tsunamis along the Chinese coast. Our results indicate that tsunami waves can be modeled with linear theory with enough accuracy in South China Sea, but the nonlinear terms should not be neglected in the eastern China Sea region.","inCitations":["ae91feb3b0da22b0bcd224d74377fade606b8858"],"pdfUrls":["http://vlab.msi.umn.edu/reports/allpublications/PapersSince2011/art_10.1007_s11440-008-0073-0.pdf","http://www.klmp.pku.edu.cn/Paper/UsrFile/587.pdf"],"title":"Comparison of linear and nonlinear shallow wave water equations applied to tsunami waves over the China Sea","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Thirty-two occupational therapy students took part in an experiential project to connect occupational engagement and health for a community of older adults. A pretest/posttest design was used to evaluate program outcomes in student perceived abilities, and narrative reflection papers provided postexperience qualitative information. The students improved in all 10 areas of abilities selfassessment with mean total scores from pretest (M = 42) improving significantly at posttest (M = 58). Themes from reflection papers indicated a positive response to experiential learning and a desire for more opportunities to prepare for clinical practice, including the use of interprofessional training. The students improved in their abilities to use coaching and health promotion strategies through the use of experiential learning methods.

Olfaction plays a crucial role in guiding cockroach behaviors and contributes to their ability to transmit pathogens. Odorant binding proteins (OBPs), abundant in the insect olfactory sensilla, are important for insect olfaction. In this study, three OBP genes, PameOBP1, 2 and 3, were cloned from P. americana. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that PameOBP1, 2 and 3 belong to the Minus-C OBP, Classic OBP, and Plus-C OBP subfamilies, respectively. Expression pattern and ligand-binding analysis showed that PameOBP1 and 2 were specifically expressed in antennae, and exhibited high binding affinities (Ki < 2 μM) to farnesene, farnesol, 2-tridecanone, and tetradecane, suggesting roles in volatile perception. Conversely, PameOBP3 was ubiquitously expressed in most of the tissues examined at high levels and displayed very weak binding affinities (Ki > 40 μM) for all 87 ligands tested. Our study provides insights into the functional diversity of PameOBP genes and provides some volatiles that can potentially be used in behavioral interference of P. americana.","inCitations":["779f405e121833bde919470c51b9bf95fbd31404","9e85cee24c320000f4400695e03fb587a2c4bba4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular and Functional Characterization of Three Odorant-Binding Protein from Periplaneta americana","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170072","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170072","venue":"PloS one"}

The widespread use of optical fiber has tremendously increased network bandwidth. Furthermore, greater CPU power, increasing disk capacity, and support for digital audio and video are creating demand for a new class of network services. For example, video-on-demand (VOD), distant learning, distant diagnosis, video conferences, and many other applications have popped up one after another in recent years. Many of these services have one thing in common. They all require that the same data be sent to multiple recipients. Even in traditional networks, this operation, called multicasting, can not be handled easily and cheaply. When scaled up to high-speed ATM-based networks, the situation becomes more difficult. Multiple data streams travel around the ATM networks with each stream sent to many different destinations simultaneously. Therefore, the networks need a very efficient algorithm for multicast routing. This paper proposes an algorithm for multicast routing in ATM networks.

Here we investigated the analgesic effects of AS1069562 in a rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain and the spinal monoamine turnover. These effects were compared with those of the antidepressants duloxetine and amitriptyline. AS1069562 significantly elevated extracellular 5-HT and NE levels in the rat spinal dorsal horn, although its 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition was much weaker than that of duloxetine in vitro. In addition, AS1069562 increased the ratio of the contents of both 5-HT and NE to their metabolites in rat spinal cord, whereas duloxetine slightly increased only the ratio of the content of 5-HT to its metabolite. In CCI rats, AS1069562 and duloxetine significantly ameliorated mechanical allodynia, whereas amitriptyline did not. AS1069562 and amitriptyline significantly ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia, and duloxetine tended to ameliorate it. Furthermore, AS1069562, duloxetine, and amitriptyline significantly improved spontaneous pain-associated behavior. In a gastric emptying study, AS1069562 affected gastric emptying at the same dose that exerted analgesia in CCI rats. On the other hand, duloxetine and amitriptyline significantly reduced gastric emptying at lower doses than those that exerted analgesic effects. These results indicate that AS1069562 broadly improved various types of neuropathic pain-related behavior in CCI rats with unique characteristics in spinal monoamine turnover, suggesting that AS1069562 may have potential as a treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain, with a different profile from currently available antidepressants.","inCitations":["cff77ca6133180edc209548b28943a9b08d06b17","fb063b9bef5e99521c813f32c94730511be4766b","20173e8d5f8f3aea5b7a9bfca7a0964d0196ea08","bfd6dd3f02daa1eae7a860f361b47e8ae7883c70","cfc99791705bed464ac6d1c2ce3ab3335a2d7f77","a00a128919eddf8c354b8770050ff2890c2ecc35"],"pdfUrls":["http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/jpet/348/3/372.full.pdf"],"title":"AS1069562, the (+)-isomer of indeloxazine, exerts analgesic effects in a rat model of neuropathic pain with unique characteristics in spinal monoamine turnover.","doi":"10.1124/jpet.113.208686","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.113.208686","venue":"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics"}

All were inactive in the hERTa assay but paracetamol, gingerol, caffeine and vitamin C affected steroidogenesis in vitro from 250, 25, 500 and 750 μM respectively. One molecule, caffeine, was further tested in rat pubertal assays at the tumorigenic dose-level and at dose-levels relevant for human consumption. In females pubertal parameters (vaginal opening, estrus cycle), ovarian weight and Fsh and prolactin transcript levels were affected. In males, plasma progesterone levels and prostate and seminal vesicle weights were affected. Although the current regulatory focus is synthetic chemicals that can cause adverse effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, our data infer that the range of natural chemicals with the potential to affect this axis may be extensive and is probably overlooked. Thus, to avoid regulation of an overwhelming number of chemicals, a weight of evidence approach, combining hazard identification and characterization with exposure considerations, is needed to identify those chemicals of real regulatory concern.","inCitations":["1e4d1ec354f54394efdd6051f5a24d97af5c3774","4b7e77f0658bea7925310e290b5ef4dd99cf500f","b7ce08251b7ee12235c8f307aafa2a1e4a42ee0e","cbfff7ca0bd6fc4144d34cb5c7489238e590541b","f3576f00a25e44442d4a0bddc708ee909be1d605","b7bdb26255a22219a968e68d40866a5ebfdf3b34","117df60fcc0886b5c3dae806529aee31bf6931cb","fe2f04f1e5b92a5d32822f5f9439b8e3b4c336bb","9d7c0c6e1abaf9d4c53bc2c368a8989f2a8cce02","b2dc4810307ee151109a55a2ed840eee034d959f","a3ee7509a3771015f57c7176ed72ad20520e6da3","9afac881a081372fd64ee2dd824c7a480aec6e2f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The screening of everyday life chemicals in validated assays targeting the pituitary-gonadal axis.","doi":"10.1016/j.yrtph.2013.04.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2013.04.002","venue":"Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP"}

Using our approach, it is possible to achieve near peak performance for transitive closure on the Cell processor. We first parallelize the Standard Floyd Warshall algorithm and show through analysis and experimental results that data communication is a bottleneck for performance and scalability. We parallelize a cache optimized version of Floyd Warshall algorithm to remove the memory bottleneck. As is the case with several scientific computing and industrial applications on a multicore processor, synchronization and scheduling of the cores plays a crucial role in determining the performance of this algorithm. We define a self-scheduling mechanism for the cores of a multicore processor and design a self-scheduler for Blocked Floyd Warshall algorithm on the Cell multicore processor to remove the scheduling bottleneck. We also present optimizations in scheduling order to remove synchronization points.

A recently conducted phase 1/2 study shows that 5F11 is well tolerated in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed and refractory CD30(+) lymphoma and has some clinical activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that 5F11 activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the anti-apoptotic protein cellular FLICE (Fas-associating protein with death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme) inhibitory protein (c-flip) in Hodgkin lymphoma (HD)-derived cell lines, which might cause apoptosis resistance, thus limiting the clinical use of 5F11. To overcome this resistance, we combined 5F11 with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which has been shown to suppress NF-kappaB activity. This combination revealed a synergistic cytotoxic effect in vitro and in a human HD xenograft model provided that 5F11 precedes bortezomib treatment. We conclude that initial 5F11-mediated NF-kappaB signaling sensitizes the tumor cells to bortezomib-induced cell death. These data suggest a therapeutic value of this combination for HD patients.","inCitations":["c87519f027c32f8e290aeeef0f910f64109eb8c9","56cb9c50f83dbbe1d406c76fa8ce5ad5dbfa941f","a33be299f480bad71a8270006a01ee4fbc8955a6","7235dbdf00d9ef199ca014e415c7c42af061b872","ea2269bbc0bf33e31d3e2fffa04f448fc8b1ba9a","c06cdab3b22e7b965148649e1d30936bef7f0c0b","aae281966039888b1c4421ecd6ee700bcb3f19ad","71a5380a92b3b17a506db79ac184cf66708b764c","86bbb765045c42613194acf0cd6aed550feb4897","0518479fb48774838c2e8c0e0e746bd073283b21","8992f99075a5c80aaac8247de20782b0e0cb4402","7d445975500738f77851385230652549c0a5324a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The fully human anti-CD30 antibody 5F11 activates NF-{kappa}B and sensitizes lymphoma cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Blood"}
